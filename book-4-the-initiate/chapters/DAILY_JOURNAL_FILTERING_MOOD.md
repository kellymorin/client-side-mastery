# Daily Journal

The learning objective for this chapter is to use radio buttons, apply your knowledge of event listeners, the `filter()` method on an array, and the `find()` method on an array to show journal entries that match a certain mood.

> **Warning:** This part of Daily Journal development will  stretch your understanding of how each of the components can be used together in a non-sequential way. If you get frustrated by not being able to **immediately** see how it all works, that's natural and normal. See your instruction team.

## Mood Radio Buttons

Using `<fieldset>`, `<legend>`, `<input type="radio">`, and `<label>` HTML components, construct a set of radio buttons for selecting one of the moods. It's important that each of the radio buttons has the same value for the `name` attribute, but each should a different value for the `value` attribute.

Before you go to the instruction team for help on this section, make sure you use the [Mozilla Developer Network article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/radio) on radio buttons as a reference first.

## Add Event Listeners

Each one of the radio buttons needs to have a click event listener attached to it. When any of them are clicked, then the only articles that should appear are the ones with the corresponding mood.

Now, you could attach the event listeners to each individually. You could also use the `document.getElementsByName()` method, and a `forEach()` to add them more dynamically.

To get the selected mood, you need to look at the value property of the radio button that was clicked. When you click on any DOM element, that element becomes the `target` of the click event. You can access the element, and its value with the code below.

```js
radioButton.addEventListener("click", event => {
    const mood = event.target.value
})
```

## Filtering the Journal Entries

Once you have successfully retrieved the value of `ok`, `happy`, or `sad` based on which radio button was clicked, you need to filter all of the journal entries. The most straightforward way of doing this is to invoke the `getJournalEntries()` method on your data manager object - which will get **all** entries - and then use the `filter()` array method to extract only the entries that have the same mood as the one the user clicked on.

Once you have filtered the entries by mood, invoke the function that renders the HTML representations to the DOM and pass it the filtered array of entries.

## Challenge - Caching Entries

> **Note**: Remember, challenges should only be attempted once you have completed the main exercise(s) and understand the concept.

Cache your journal entries when you retrieve them from the API. [Caching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_(computing)) is an important part of keeping the World Wide Web flexible and responsive. If a resources, or a collection of resources (e.g. your journal entries) have not changed, then you should not have to make an unnecessary call to your API to get them again for this exercise.
